"""file objects contain a special pair of built-in methods: __enter__() and __exit__(). 
The details aren't important, but what is important is that when a file object's __exit__() method is invoked,
 it automatically closes the file.
 How do we invoke this method? With command with and command as.

"""Any code you would normally write outside of a block to work with a file 
could be written inside of a with-as code block.
Just be sure to indent your code using 2 spaces per indentation level, depending on compliler, 
otherwise Python wonâ€™t know that you intended for the code to be part of the with-as block. 
Failing to indent will cause an error if you try accessing anything you created inside of that code block,
or trying to access the file variable."""
